## The Ultimate Contact Manager

### Project Goals

1. Track people you encounter any way you want.

1. Web/cloud storage for maximum portability, but user can store locally, on their own cloud service, or on a hosted
   service. User data should be easily exported to a number of formats and never locked in to one service.

1. Should be extremely flexible, allowing for unusual situations, without allowing common data errors you see in other
   apps.

1. Track relationships between people (child, spouse, co-worker) and organizations (works for, member of).

1. Should be usable on desktop computers, tablets, and phones at a minimum. Currently it's expected to be a web app, not
   native, but this is not a goal.

1. Separate front and back ends, using a standard API, to allow flexibility in the front end.

1. Allow for free-form notes and journal entries, as well as the standard fields, so that a variety of custom uses are
   possible.

### Current Status

Pre-pre-pre-alpha. Just some basic models for some ideas I have.
